# Overview

ImmuneWatchâ€™s DETECT platform uses machine learning to annotate the epitope specificity of T-cell receptor (TCR) sequences. The algorithm obtained the highest classification score in a public benchmark organised by top scientists in the field.

Use the ImmuneWatch database, IMWdb, to track more than 1900 different epitopes. IMWdb is curated by professionals and leads to the best performance of ImmuneWatch DETECT. New epitopes related to viruses, bacteria and cancers are added every month. Alternatively, you can provide your own custom training dataset to find TCRs specific to your epitope of interest.
